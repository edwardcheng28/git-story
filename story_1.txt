The story of a meatball

On top of spaghetti, all covered in cheese, a poor meatball rolled off the plate, past the table, and onto the floor. it kept rolling and rolling until it rolled out the door. It rolled to the sidewalk, and into the yard, where a dog eventually ate the delicious meatball, making them a happy dog.
